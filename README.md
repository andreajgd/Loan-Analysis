# ✧ Bank Loan Analysis

This repository is a dive into **financial data analysis**, using Python to uncover the stories hidden within a loan dataset.  
Its core purpose is understanding **loan performance**.


## ✧ What's Inside?

This project analyzes loan performance and focuses on two main areas:

1. **The Big Picture Metrics**  
   Key performance indicators (KPIs) analyzed include:  
   - Total Loan Applications  
   - Total Funded Amount  
   - Average Interest Rate  
   - Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)  

2. **The Good, the Bad, and the Data**  
   A direct comparison of *good loans* versus *bad loans*.  
   By comparing key metrics, we uncover insights into the factors that influence a loan's success or failure.  


## 📊 A Visual Story

The project comes with clear, insightful visualizations:

- 🗓️ **Spotting Trends** – Monthly charts to reveal seasonality.  
- 🗺️ **Pinpointing Hotspots** – Bar charts that break down lending by state.  
- ⏳ **Understanding the "Why"** – Donut chart of loan terms & bar chart of borrowing purposes.  
- 👨‍💼 **Exploring the Human Factor** – Charts on employment length & home ownership to see how borrower characteristics impact loan outcomes.
